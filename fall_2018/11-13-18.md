## Last Week's Accomplishments

> #### Fully ported over code to Express

> #### Developed a table system to represent player data. 
> #### Can be sorted or reverse sorted by any player's stat or descriptor available


## This Week's Plan

>#### Merge code with Gabe to bolster the front end

> #### Integrating the backend data with the tables

> #### The current styling is pretty ugly, Gabe and I will look to use Bootstrap or something similar to clean up the style

## Anything Blocking?

> #### I have limited knowledge of serving up data from a server. I will work with Colin to integerate this

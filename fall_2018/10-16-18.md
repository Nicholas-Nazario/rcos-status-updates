## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Sat down with the team and layed out consistent design parameters

> Created a logo, both minituized and full scale

> Began creating the tables to hold player data

## This Week's Plan

> Polish the logos in photoshop to be used on the site

> Continue implemention of the table setup to store data for analysis

## Anything Blocking?

> I'm feeling much more confident with AngularJS

> The NFLDB is not connected at the moment, so the tables will be populated with dummy data

## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Divided the team into small subgroups including, front-end, back-end, architecture.
> I will be working on the front end with Gabe. We will be developing in AngularJS, so I've been learning about that
>Cloned an angular-seed repository from GitHub and began tinkering with it

## This Week's Plan

> Modify the angular-seed repo to bette represent the design and information we want to represent

> Gabe and I will have to sit down this week and create a preliminary layot for the site

## Anything Blocking?

> Currently, the only road block is my lack of knowledge of AngularJS. I'm actively learning more about it.

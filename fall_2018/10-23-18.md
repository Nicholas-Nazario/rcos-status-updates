## Last Week's Accomplishments

> #### Implemented master table with dynamic sorting options

> #### Connected the master table to dummy data

> #### Sat down with the team and layed out the type of data we need to get on the backend and represent on the front end

## This Week's Plan

> #### I didn't get around to the logos, so I will try to work on those in photoshop

> #### Fix an error where the user cannot change the sort type via the implemented buttons
*  The sorting works by manually changing the vairable values, but the buttons do not do this properly

## Anything Blocking?

> #### My errors seem to come back to the small quirks of AngularJS that I'm not used to
